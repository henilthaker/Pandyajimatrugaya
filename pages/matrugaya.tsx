                <h2>History of Matrugaya</h2>
                <p>
                    Kapila took over management of the ashram after Sage Kardam left it to live as a hermit in Bindu Sarovar. One day, his mother Devahuti recalled that Vishnu had taken the form of Kapila in order to propagate the philosophy of Sankhya Yoga, which combines devotional service and mystical realisation. The talks Kapila gave him were to be used to convey this point. He told his kid that he was prepared and eager to learn from him and addressed him as Lord Almighty. He claimed that his involvement with his material senses had upset him, and he had turned to matrugaya for rescue.
